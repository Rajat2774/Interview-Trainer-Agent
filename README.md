# 💼 AI Interview Trainer Agent (RAG-based, IBM watsonx)

## 📌 Problem Statement

Job seekers often face difficulty in preparing effectively for interviews due to a lack of structured, personalized guidance. The core challenge is to assist candidates using an intelligent tool that provides targeted preparation strategies based on their **profile name**, **experience level**, and **job role**.

This project introduces an AI-powered **Interview Trainer Agent**, built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. It generates tailored interview question sets, industry-specific expectations, behavioral scenarios, and HR guidelines using a curated knowledge base. The user can input a **resume** or **job title**, and the system returns role-specific questions, model answers, and improvement tips — covering both technical and soft skills — to help users build confidence and improve their chances in competitive interviews.

## 🚀 Proposed System / Solution

The solution is a **conversational AI agent**, hosted on **IBM watsonx**, designed to act as a personal interview coach.

### Key Features:
- 📄 Accepts job titles or resumes.
- 🧠 Provides role-specific interview questions and structured preparation roadmaps.
- 🎯 Covers technical questions, behavioral scenarios, and company-specific research tips.
- 💬 Built using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** grounded with a **custom knowledge base** for high relevance.

This makes the agent capable of giving **context-aware**, **personalized** preparation advice.

## 🧮 Algorithm and Workflow

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

1. **Vectorization**: The uploaded `.docx` file is chunked and converted to vector embeddings using watsonx.
2. **Retrieval**: A user query is vectorized and compared with the KB to retrieve the top relevant chunks.
3. **Augmentation**: These relevant chunks are prepended to the user query to create an **augmented prompt**.
4. **Generation**: The augmented prompt is passed to the LLM (e.g., `mistral-large`) to generate a detailed, context-rich response.

## 🧪 Deployment

- Built within **IBM watsonx Agent Lab**.
- Deployed using the **"Deploy"** feature.
- Available as a **web chatbot** or **API endpoint**.
- Can be embedded in web apps, mobile platforms, or third-party tools.
